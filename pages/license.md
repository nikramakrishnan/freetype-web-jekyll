FreeType comes with two licenses from which you can choose the one which
fits your needs best.

-   The [FreeType
    License](http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/freetype/freetype2.git/tree/docs/FTL.TXT)
    (FTL) is the most commonly used one. It is a BSD-style license with
    a credit clause and thus compatible with the GNU Public License
    (GPL) version 3, but not with the GPL version 2.

-   The [GNU General Public
    License](http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/freetype/freetype2.git/tree/docs/GPLv2.TXT)
    (GPL), version 2. Use it for all projects which use the GPLv2 also,
    or which need a license compatible to the GPLv2.
